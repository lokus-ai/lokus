# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
support@lokusmd.com or by opening a confidential issue on GitHub.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Lokus-Specific Guidelines

### Communication Channels

We use the following channels for community interaction:

- **Email**: support@lokusmd.com for private matters

### Expected Behavior in Different Contexts

#### Code Reviews

- Be constructive and specific in feedback
- Assume good intentions
- Ask questions rather than making demands
- Appreciate the time contributors have invested
- Remember that everyone was a beginner once

#### Issue Discussions

- Search for existing issues before creating new ones
- Provide clear reproduction steps for bugs
- Be patient with maintainers (they're volunteers)
- Stay on topic
- Use appropriate labels and formatting

#### Feature Requests

- Explain the use case, not just the feature
- Be open to alternative solutions
- Understand that not all features will be implemented
- Consider contributing code if you have the skills

#### Community Discussions

- Welcome newcomers warmly
- Share knowledge generously
- Celebrate others' successes
- Admit when you don't know something
- Stay positive and encouraging

### Scope of Moderation

We will moderate:

- All GitHub repositories under lokus-ai
- Official Discord server (if established)
- Official social media accounts
- Any official Lokus community space

We cannot moderate:

- Private conversations
- Third-party forums or social media
- Personal projects using Lokus code

However, serious violations in external spaces may affect community standing if
they impact the safety of our community members.

### Reporting Guidelines

When reporting a Code of Conduct violation, please include:

- Your contact information
- Names (usernames) of people involved
- When and where the incident occurred
- Description of what happened
- Links to relevant conversations/content
- Any additional context that would be helpful

Reports will be kept confidential. We will protect the identity of reporters
unless legally required to disclose or you explicitly give permission.

### Response Time

We aim to:

- Acknowledge reports within 48 hours
- Complete initial investigation within 7 days
- Provide outcome to reporter within 14 days

Complex cases may take longer, but we'll keep you informed of our progress.

### Appeals Process

If you feel an enforcement decision was unfair:

1. Email support@lokusmd.com with "Code of Conduct Appeal" in subject
2. Explain why you believe the decision was incorrect
3. Provide any additional context or evidence
4. A different community leader will review the case
5. The appeal decision is final

### Conflict of Interest

If a community leader has a conflict of interest in a Code of Conduct case:

- They must recuse themselves from the investigation
- Another community leader will handle the case
- If all leaders have conflicts, we'll seek external mediation
