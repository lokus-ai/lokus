Subject: Simple Format Test Email
Body:
This is a test using the simple field format.

No YAML frontmatter needed - just use:
- To: email@example.com  
- Subject: Your subject
- Body: (then everything after this line is the email body)

This format is more user-friendly and less likely to break if someone accidentally deletes formatting.

Best regards,
Simple Format Email System
