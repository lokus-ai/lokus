# üöÄ Introducing Lokus: The Markdown Editor That Adapts to You

*Building the note-taking experience I always wanted but couldn't find*

---

## The Problem With Note-Taking Apps

After years of jumping between Obsidian, Notion, Typora, and countless others, I kept hitting the same frustrations:

- **Rigid interfaces** that force you into their way of working
- **Complex setup processes** that require hours of configuration
- **Poor performance** from web-based or overly complex applications  
- **Mediocre math rendering** that breaks your flow
- **Privacy concerns** with cloud-dependent solutions
- **Wiki links that feel like an afterthought** instead of a core thinking tool

Every app seemed to make you choose: power or simplicity, customization or performance, features or privacy.

**What if you didn't have to choose?**

## Introducing Lokus

Lokus is a lightning-fast, infinitely customizable markdown editor built with one core philosophy: **the app should adapt to you, not the other way around**.

### üé® True Customization Without Complexity

Most editors give you a dark mode toggle and call it customization. Lokus gives you **real-time control over everything**:

- **Fonts**: Choose from system fonts or import your own
- **Colors**: Customize editor background, text colors, accent colors
- **Spacing**: Adjust line height, margins, and padding to your preference  
- **Themes**: Built-in presets or create your own from scratch

The magic? **See changes instantly**. No config files, no restarts, no complex setup. Change something and watch it update in real-time.

### üß† Wiki Links That Help You Think

Wiki links shouldn't just navigate between files - they should help you **connect ideas**.

Lokus features:
- **Content-aware autocomplete**: Suggestions based on actual note content, not just filenames
- **Bidirectional linking**: See what links to what automatically
- **Smart suggestions**: The app learns your linking patterns and suggests connections
- **Graph visualization** (coming soon): Visualize your knowledge network

Type `[[` and watch Lokus understand what you're thinking.

### üßÆ Math That Actually Works

LaTeX math rendering in most editors feels like an afterthought. In Lokus, it's **seamless**:

**Inline math**: `$E = mc^2$` renders beautifully in your text flow  
**Block equations**: 
```
$$
\int_0^‚àû e^{-x} dx = 1
$$
```

Powered by KaTeX for lightning-fast, pixel-perfect rendering. Perfect for students, researchers, engineers, and anyone who thinks in equations.

### ‚ö° Native Performance You Can Feel

Built with **Tauri and Rust**, Lokus delivers desktop-class performance:

- **Instant startup** - No loading screens
- **Smooth scrolling** - Even with massive documents  
- **Fast search** - Find anything in milliseconds
- **Low memory usage** - Efficient resource management

Web apps can't match this. Electron apps wish they could.

### üîí Your Data, Your Device

In an age of cloud everything, Lokus is **proudly local-first**:

- **No tracking** - We don't know what you write
- **No analytics** - Your usage patterns stay private
- **No cloud dependencies** - Works offline, always
- **No account required** - Just download and use

Your notes live on your device. Period.

## Built in the Open

Lokus isn't just open source - it's **community-driven**. We've already got:

- **50+ contributors** building features together
- **Comprehensive test suite** with 95%+ coverage
- **Beginner-friendly issues** for new contributors  
- **Active Discord community** for real-time collaboration
- **Transparent roadmap** shaped by user feedback

Every feature request gets considered. Every bug report gets addressed. Every contributor gets recognized.

## The Technical Foundation

For the developers curious about what's under the hood:

**Frontend**: React 19 + TipTap editor framework  
**Backend**: Rust + Tauri for native performance  
**Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E  
**Math**: KaTeX for beautiful equation rendering  
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theming system  
**Build**: Vite for blazing-fast development  
**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and releases  

The architecture prioritizes **performance**, **extensibility**, and **developer experience**.
