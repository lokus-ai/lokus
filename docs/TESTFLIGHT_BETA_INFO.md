# TestFlight Beta Information

## Test Information (What to Test)

Hey! Thanks for helping test Lokus.

This is a markdown editor built for people who like connecting their notes together. Think of it like a personal wiki where everything links to everything else.

Here's what would be super helpful to test:
- Create some notes and try linking them with [[double brackets]]
- Switch between light and dark themes
- Try the search - does it find what you're looking for?
- Import your own markdown files if you have any
- Just use it for a bit and see if anything breaks or feels weird

If something crashes or doesn't work right, let me know. Also if something just feels off or confusing, that's good feedback too.

## App Description

Lokus is a markdown note-taking app that lets you link your notes together like a personal wiki. Write in markdown, connect ideas with wiki-style links, and build your own knowledge base.

No cloud sync, no accounts - just local files you control. It's basically for people who want something between a simple text editor and a full wiki system.

## Beta App Review Notes (for Apple reviewers)

This is a local markdown editor - no login required, no external services. Just open the app and start writing. Files are stored locally on the user's Mac.
