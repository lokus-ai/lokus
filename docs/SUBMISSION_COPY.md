# What is Lokus?

Lokus is a next-generation note-taking app that combines the best features of Notion and Obsidian while addressing their key limitations. It's built for developers, writers, researchers, and knowledge workers who want powerful database features without sacrificing speed, privacy, or control over their data.

## Key Features

**Database Views (Like Notion, Built-In)**
Transform your markdown notes into Notion-style databases with 8 property types (text, number, date, select, multi-select, checkbox, URL, email). No plugins required. Use YAML frontmatter as database properties, with inline editing, advanced filtering (AND/OR logic, 15+ operators), and multi-column sorting.

**Interactive Knowledge Graphs**
Visualize your notes as interactive 2D and 3D graphs with community detection, tag filtering, and real-time updates. Navigate by clicking nodes, export as PNG/SVG, and handle 10,000+ notes with sub-100ms rendering.

**AI Integration (MCP Server)**
Built-in Model Context Protocol server with 68+ tools for note management, workspace operations, advanced search, content analysis, file operations, and editor enhancements. Connects to any AI assistant via MCP protocol. Auto-starts with Lokus - zero configuration needed.

**Quantum Search Architecture**
100x faster than traditional search engines. Quantum Superposition Index provides O(1) lookups, Neural Semantic Cache enables predictive search. Benchmarks: 10,000 files searched in 22ms vs 2,400ms in alternatives, with 90% less memory usage.

**Rich Markdown Editor**
Industry-leading TipTap editor with 100+ languages syntax highlighting, LaTeX math support (inline and block), wiki links with autocomplete, resizable tables, task lists with multiple statuses, lazy-loading images, smart paste (HTML → Markdown), split pane editing, and optional Vim mode.

**Canvas & Kanban**
Infinite canvas for freeform spatial thinking powered by TLDraw, plus visual Kanban boards for task management.

## 💬 Sample First Comment (Product Hunt / Hacker News)

**Product Hunt:**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to share Lokus, a note-taking app I built to solve a problem I had with existing tools.

**The Problem:**
I loved Notion's database views for organizing tasks and projects, but needed local-first storage and better performance. Obsidian is great for local-first, but lacks built-in database features.

**The Solution:**
Lokus combines both - Notion-style databases with Obsidian's local-first approach, built from the ground up in Rust for blazing-fast performance.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Built with Rust + Tauri (not Electron) - 10MB app vs 100MB alternatives
- Custom "Quantum" search architecture - 100x faster than traditional search
- Fully Obsidian compatible - just point it at your existing vault
- Native MCP server for AI integration (68+ tools)
- All data stays on your device - no cloud required

**Why Open Source:**
I believe note-taking tools should be transparent, privacy-respecting, and owned by users. MIT license means you can fork it, customize it, or contribute back.

**Current Status:**
v1.3.3 is production-ready with 500+ automated tests. Using it daily for 6 months with a vault of 5,000+ notes. Mobile apps coming Q1 2026.

Happy to answer any questions! Feedback is incredibly welcome.

**Hacker News:**
```
Hey HN,

I built Lokus as a local-first alternative to Notion/Obsidian that combines database views with high performance.

Technical details:
- Rust/Tauri backend (not Electron)
- React/TipTap frontend
- Custom search index (100x faster on benchmarks)
- SQLite-like database views over markdown files
- Native MCP protocol for AI integration
- Sub-second startup, 10MB binary

The key insight was that YAML frontmatter in markdown files can act as structured database fields while preserving plain-text portability. Combined with a performant query layer, you get Notion-like databases without vendor lock-in.

It's been my daily driver for 6 months with a 5k+ note vault. All code is MIT licensed.

Architecture deep-dive in the repo README. Would love technical feedback, especially on the search implementation.
