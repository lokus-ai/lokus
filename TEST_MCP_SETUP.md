# MCP Server Testing Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed & Improved

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes
1. ✅ Created `standalone.js` - The MCP server can now start properly
2. ✅ Fixed all import paths - No more missing file errors
3. ✅ Moved `middleware.js` and `websocket.js` to correct locations
4. ✅ Fixed typo in `MCPServerHost.js:635` (healthySer → healthyServers)

### Phase 2: State-of-the-Art GUI
1. ✅ Created beautiful `MCPServerSettings.jsx` component with:
   - Real-time status monitoring (🟢 Running / ⚫ Stopped)
   - One-click Start/Stop/Restart buttons
   - Connection testing
   - Auto-configure AI Desktop button
   - Advanced settings (port config, auto-start)
   - Professional error display
   - Built-in help documentation

2. ✅ Integrated into Preferences view
   - New "MCP Integration" tab in Settings
   - Clean, intuitive UI matching Lokus design

### Phase 3: HTTP Transport (THE GAME CHANGER)
1. ✅ Migrated from stdio to HTTP transport
   - **No more Node.js path issues**
   - **Works from any directory**
   - **Can be tested in browser** (http://localhost:3456/health)
   - **Multiple simultaneous connections**
   - **Better error messages**

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Start Lokus
```bash
cd "/Users/pratham/Programming/Lokud Dir/Lokus"
npm run tauri dev
```

### Step 2: Open MCP Settings
1. Launch Lokus app
2. Go to **Preferences** (Cmd+, or File → Preferences)
3. Click **"MCP Integration"** tab in sidebar

### Step 3: Start the Server
1. Click the **"Start"** button
2. Wait for status to show **🟢 Running**
3. Note the connection URL: `http://localhost:3456`

### Step 4: Test Connection
1. Click **"Test Connection"** button
2. Should show: ✅ "Server is healthy and responding"

### Step 5: Configure AI Apps (One-Click for BOTH!)
1. Click **"Auto-Configure AI Apps"** button
2. Wait for success message - configures BOTH Desktop and CLI
3. Restart your AI apps (both Desktop and VS Code)

### Step 6: Verify in Browser
```bash
# Open in your browser:
open http://localhost:3456/health

# Or use curl:
curl http://localhost:3456/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T...",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### Step 7: Check Configs (Both Desktop & CLI)

**Desktop Config:**
```bash
# macOS:
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

**CLI Config:**
```bash
# macOS:
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude\ Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json
```

**Both should show:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lokus": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3456/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Start/Stop
- ✅ Start server → Status shows 🟢 Running
- ✅ Stop server → Status shows ⚫ Stopped
- ✅ Restart server → Server restarts successfully

### Scenario 2: Connection Testing
- ✅ Test connection while running → ✅ Success
- ✅ Test connection while stopped → ❌ Error (expected)

### Scenario 3: Auto-Configure
- ✅ Click configure → Creates/updates BOTH Desktop and CLI configs
- ✅ Both configs use HTTP transport
- ✅ Restart AI apps → Lokus MCP server appears in both

### Scenario 4: Directory Independence
- ✅ Start server from Lokus dir → Works ✅
- ✅ Change directory → Server still works ✅
- ✅ Access from AI app → Works ✅
- ✅ No "module not found" errors ✅

### Scenario 5: Error Handling
- ✅ Start on occupied port → Shows clear error
- ✅ Invalid port number → Validation error
- ✅ Network issues → Clear error message

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Address already in use"
**Solution:** Port 3456 is occupied
```bash
# Find and kill the process:
lsof -i :3456
kill -9 <PID>

# Or change port in Advanced Settings
```

### Issue 2: "Server not responding"
**Solution:** Check if server is actually running
```bash
# Check process:
ps aux | grep "node.*standalone.js"

# Check logs in Lokus terminal
```

### Issue 3: "Desktop or CLI not connecting"
**Solution:** Verify config and restart AI app
```bash
# Check Desktop config:
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# Check CLI config:
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude\ Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json

# Restart the specific AI app completely (quit and reopen)
```

### Issue 4: "Module not found" (Old stdio issues)
**Solution:** Should NOT happen with HTTP transport!
- If you see this, you might be using old stdio config
- Re-run "Configure AI Desktop" to update to HTTP

## 📊 Success Criteria

Your MCP setup is working correctly if:
- ✅ Server starts with one click
- ✅ Status shows 🟢 Running
- ✅ Test connection succeeds
- ✅ Browser shows health endpoint
- ✅ BOTH Desktop and CLI configs are updated
- ✅ Both AI apps show "lokus" server
- ✅ No directory-related errors
- ✅ Works from any location

## 🎉 What Users Will Experience

### Before (Old System):
- ❌ Had to run commands in specific directory
- ❌ Node.js path issues
- ❌ "Module not found" errors
- ❌ Had to edit JSON manually
- ❌ Confusing for non-technical users

### After (New System):
- ✅ **One-click start from GUI**
- ✅ **Visual status indicators**
- ✅ **Works from any directory (HTTP transport)**
- ✅ **Auto-configure button for BOTH Desktop & CLI**
- ✅ **Test connection button**
- ✅ **Clear error messages**
- ✅ **Professional UI**
- ✅ **Perfect for non-technical users**
- ✅ **Simultaneous connections from multiple apps**

## 📝 Next Steps for Production

1. **Add Notifications**
   - Toast messages for success/error
   - System notifications for server events

2. **Auto-Start Option**
   - Implement auto-start toggle
   - Start server when Lokus launches

3. **Server Logs Viewer**
   - Add logs panel in Advanced settings
   - Real-time log streaming

4. **MCP Bundle (.mcpb)**
   - Package as one-click installable bundle
   - Publish to MCP marketplace

5. **Multi-App Support**
   - Quick buttons for VS Code, Cursor, etc.
   - Detect installed AI apps automatically

## 🔍 Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check if server is running:
lsof -i :3456

# Test health endpoint:
curl http://localhost:3456/health

# Check logs:
# (Logs appear in Lokus terminal/console)

# Verify config:
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# Kill server if stuck:
pkill -f "node.*standalone.js"
```
