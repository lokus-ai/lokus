# 🤔 Ethics in Artificial Intelligence

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations
Responsible AI development building on [[Research/AI/Machine Learning Basics]].

### Key Principles
- Fairness and bias mitigation
- Transparency and explainability  
- Privacy and data protection
- Accountability and governance

### Bias Detection
Mathematical bias measure: $bias = E[f(X)|A=1] - E[f(X)|A=0]$

## 🔍 Case Studies
- Hiring algorithms
- Credit scoring systems
- Healthcare diagnosis tools
