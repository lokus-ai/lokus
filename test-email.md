subject: Test Email from Lokus - Fixed Body Issue
body: |
  This is a test email sent from the Lokus application to verify the Gmail integration is working correctly.
  
  The email functionality has been fixed and should now work properly with flexible parsing that supports:
  
  - YAML frontmatter with explicit body field
  - Simple field format (To:, Subject:, Body:)
  - Markdown bold format for legacy support
  
  This body content should now appear correctly in the sent email!
  
  Best regards,
  Lokus Email System
