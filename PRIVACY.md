# Privacy Policy for Lokus

**Last Updated: November 21, 2025**

## Introduction

Lokus ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our note-taking application.

## Data Collection

### Local-Only Data Storage

Lokus is designed with privacy as a core principle. **All your notes, files, and personal data are stored locally on your device.** We do not:

- Upload your notes to any cloud servers
- Transmit your personal data to third parties
- Track your usage patterns
- Collect analytics or telemetry data

### Data We Do Not Collect

- Personal identification information (name, email, etc.)
- Note contents or file metadata
- Usage statistics or analytics
- Location data
- Device information beyond what's necessary for the app to function

### Optional OAuth Authentication

If you choose to use OAuth authentication features (Google, GitHub, etc.):

- Authentication tokens are stored locally on your device
- We use industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocols
- Authentication occurs directly between your device and the OAuth provider
- We do not store or have access to your OAuth credentials
- You can revoke OAuth access at any time through your provider's account settings

### Auto-Update Feature

Lokus includes an auto-update mechanism that:

- Checks GitHub releases for new versions
- Downloads update files directly from GitHub
- Does not transmit any personal data during update checks
- Only sends standard HTTP request headers (user agent, OS version)

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage

- All data is stored in your local file system at the location you specify
- You maintain complete control over your data
- You can back up your data using your preferred backup solution
- Deleting the app does not automatically delete your notes (they remain in your file system)

### Security Measures

- No cloud transmission means no risk of data breaches in transit
- Your data security depends on your device's security measures
- We recommend using full-disk encryption on your device
- Regular backups to secure locations are your responsibility

## Third-Party Services

### OAuth Providers (Optional)

If you use OAuth authentication, you interact directly with third-party providers (Google, GitHub, etc.). Their privacy policies apply to data they collect:

- Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
- GitHub Privacy Policy: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement

### GitHub Releases

The auto-updater checks GitHub's public API for new releases. GitHub's privacy policy applies:
- https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:

- **Access**: You can access all your data at any time
- **Modification**: You can edit or modify your notes freely
- **Deletion**: You can delete any data by deleting files from your file system
- **Export**: All notes are stored as standard Markdown files, easily exportable
- **Portability**: Your data is stored in open formats (Markdown, JSON)

## Children's Privacy

Lokus does not knowingly collect any information from children. Since we don't collect user data, the app can be used by anyone, but parental supervision is recommended for minors.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the app repository
- Updating the "Last Updated" date
- Including a notice in release notes if changes are significant

## Open Source Transparency

Lokus is open-source software. You can review our code to verify our privacy practices:
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/lokus-ai/lokus
- Our code is auditable by anyone
- We welcome security reviews and privacy audits

## Contact Us

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices:

- Open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/lokus-ai/lokus/issues
- Email: support@lokusmd.com
- Website: https://lokusmd.com

## Compliance

This privacy policy is designed to comply with:

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Other applicable privacy laws

Since we don't collect or process personal data on servers, most data protection regulations' requirements are naturally satisfied by our local-only architecture.

## Data Breach Notification

In the unlikely event of a security vulnerability that could affect your data:

- We will disclose it immediately through GitHub security advisories
- We will provide clear instructions on how to protect your data
- We will release a patch as quickly as possible

## Your Consent

By using Lokus, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the app.

**Lokus is committed to your privacy. Your notes are yours, and yours alone.**
