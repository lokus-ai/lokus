# 🚀 Social Media Content for Lokus Launch

## LinkedIn Launch Post

🚀 **I'm thrilled to announce the launch of Lokus - a lightning-fast markdown editor that's changing how we think about note-taking!** 

After months of development, we've built something truly special:

✨ **What makes Lokus different?**
• Real-time customization - change fonts, colors, themes with live preview

• Native desktop performance (built with Rust + Tauri)
• Complete privacy - your notes never leave your device

🎯 **Built for everyone:**
• Writers who need distraction-free environments
• Students managing complex research with math equations
• Developers who want extensible, hackable tools
• Teams looking for local-first collaboration

💡 **The story behind Lokus:**
Frustrated by rigid note-taking apps that force you into their boxes, I set out to build something different. Lokus puts YOU in control - customize everything, connect ideas naturally, and work at the speed of thought.

🧵 2/8

**Problem:** Every note app forces you into THEIR way of working.

Obsidian is too complex for casual users. Notion is slow and cloud-dependent. Apple Notes lacks power features. 

**Solution:** Infinite customization with zero learning curve.

Change fonts, colors, spacing - see results instantly. No config files. No complex setups.

**The wiki link experience you've been waiting for** 🔗

Type `[[` and get intelligent suggestions. Not just file names - actual content-aware autocomplete.

Connect ideas naturally. Build knowledge graphs that make sense.

Finally, linking that helps you think. 🧠

**Math that actually works** 🧮

LaTeX rendering so smooth you'll forget it's not native:

Inline: $E = mc^2$
Block: $$\int_0^∞ e^{-x} dx = 1$$

No weird syntax. No rendering delays. Just beautiful math that works.

Perfect for students, researchers, engineers. ✍️

**I built a markdown editor that doesn't make you compromise [Open Source]**

After using Obsidian, Notion, Typora, and dozens of others, I was frustrated by the same issues:

- Complex setup processes
- Rigid UI that you can't customize  
- Poor math rendering
- Slow performance or cloud dependencies
- Wiki links that feel like an afterthought

So I built Lokus - a markdown editor focused on three things:

1. **Infinite customization with zero complexity** - Real-time theme editor, custom fonts, live preview of changes
2. **Native performance** - Built with Tauri (Rust) for desktop-class speed
3. **Intelligent features** - Wiki links with content-aware autocomplete, seamless LaTeX math, smart paste

**Tech stack:**
- Frontend: React + TipTap editor
- Backend: Rust + Tauri
- Testing: Vitest + Playwright E2E
- Math: KaTeX rendering
- Deployment: GitHub Actions CI/CD

**What's different:**
- Real-time customization (change anything, see results instantly)
- Wiki links that actually help you think (not just file navigation)
- Local-first (your data never touches our servers)
- Extensible plugin architecture (coming soon)

**Try it:** https://github.com/CodeWithInferno/Lokus

We're at 50+ contributors and growing. Would love feedback from the community!

**The problem:** Every note app makes you choose between power and simplicity.

- Obsidian = Powerful but overwhelming

- Others = Cloud-dependent privacy nightmares

**The solution: Lokus** - Infinite customization meets zero learning curve.

**Why you'll love it:**
• Change fonts, colors, spacing with live preview (no config files!)
• Wiki links with intelligent autocomplete (helps you think, not just navigate)
• Beautiful LaTeX math rendering for students/researchers
• Native desktop speed (built with Rust)
• Completely private (local-first, no tracking)

**Perfect for:**
