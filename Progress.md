### **3. Advanced Tab Bar Controls**
- **Split Direction Toggle** - switch between vertical/horizontal layouts
- **Pane Size Reset** - one-click return to 50/50 ratio
- **Synchronized Scrolling Toggle** - link/unlink pane scrolling
- **Smart Control Visibility** - controls only appear when relevant
- **Professional Icons** - clear visual indicators for each function

### **4. Synchronized Scrolling**
- **Proportional scrolling** - scroll one pane, other follows proportionally
- **Toggle on/off** - user can enable/disable as needed
- **Smart calculation** - handles different content lengths correctly
- **Smooth synchronization** - no jarring jumps or delays

### **5. Keyboard Shortcuts**
- **`lokus:toggle-split-view`** - Enable/disable split view
- **`lokus:toggle-split-direction`** - Switch vertical/horizontal
- **`lokus:reset-pane-size`** - Reset to 50/50 split
- **`lokus:toggle-sync-scrolling`** - Toggle synchronized scrolling
- **Event-based system** - proper cleanup and memory management

### **6. Enhanced User Experience**
- **Independent scrolling** - each pane scrolls separately by default
- **Scroll preservation** - no jumping when switching tabs
- **Smooth animations** - professional feel with proper transitions
- **Error handling** - graceful fallbacks for edge cases
- **Memory efficiency** - proper state management and cleanup

### **7. Universal File Type Support**
- **Markdown files** - full editor support in both panes
- **Kanban boards** - proper FullKanban component rendering
- **Graph views** - ProfessionalGraphView component support
- **Canvas files** - Canvas component with save functionality
- **Plugin views** - PluginDetail component rendering
- **Mixed content** - different file types in each pane simultaneously
