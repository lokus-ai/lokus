**Audience:** Product Hunt community (early adopters, builders, tech enthusiasts)

---

## INTRO (0:00 - 0:15)
*[VISUAL: Clean title card with Lokus logo]*

> "Hey Product Hunt! I'm excited to introduce Lokus — the open source note-taking app I've been building."

*[VISUAL: Quick app interface reveal]*

> "Think of it as what Obsidian would be if it was actually open source and didn't charge for sync."

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:30)
*[VISUAL: Split screen — Obsidian pricing / Notion cloud dependency]*

> "Here's the thing. Obsidian is powerful, but it's closed source and sync costs ten dollars a month. Notion is feature-rich, but your data lives on their servers. For a lot of us, that's a dealbreaker."

*[VISUAL: Transition to Lokus interface]*

> "I wanted something different."

---

## THE SOLUTION (0:30 - 0:55)
*[VISUAL: File system showing .md files, then editor]*

> "Lokus is local-first. Your notes are standard markdown files on YOUR device. No proprietary format. Open them in any text editor. They're yours forever."

*[VISUAL: Show wiki link typing with autocomplete]*

> "But it's not just a text editor. Wiki links connect your notes like a personal Wikipedia."

*[VISUAL: Graph view reveal]*

> "The graph view shows how all your ideas connect. It's like seeing your brain mapped out."

## KEY FEATURES (0:55 - 1:25)
*[VISUAL: Quick feature montage with labels]*

> "What else?"

*[VISUAL: Task states cycling]*
> "Eighteen different task states — way beyond just checkboxes."

*[VISUAL: Canvas with cards and drawings]*
> "An infinite canvas for visual thinking and brainstorming."

*[VISUAL: Slash command menu]*
> "Over forty slash commands for power users."

*[VISUAL: Template applying]*
> "A template system with ninety plus features — variables, conditionals, date math, the works."

*[VISUAL: Theme switching]*
> "Full theming support. Make it look however you want."

---

## TECH & OPEN SOURCE (1:25 - 1:45)
*[VISUAL: GitHub repo, code, Tauri/Rust logos]*

> "This is built with Tauri and Rust — not Electron. So it's actually fast and doesn't eat your RAM."

*[VISUAL: License badge, contributor list]*

> "And it's fully open source. MIT licensed. Star it, fork it, contribute — this is a community project."

---

## ROADMAP TEASE (1:45 - 1:52)
*[VISUAL: Abstract P2P network visualization]*

> "Coming soon: peer-to-peer sync. Your devices syncing directly without a cloud middleman. Free forever."

---

## CALL TO ACTION (1:52 - 2:00)
*[VISUAL: Product Hunt upvote button, download links]*

> "Lokus is free and available now for Mac, Windows, and Linux. If this resonates with you, I'd love your support. Thanks for checking it out!"

*[VISUAL: Logo + "Free & Open Source" tagline]*
