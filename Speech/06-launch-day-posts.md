## PRODUCT HUNT FIRST MAKER COMMENT

**Post this immediately after your Product Hunt goes live:**

---

Hey everyone! Thanks for checking out Lokus.

**The short version:** I built an open-source Obsidian alternative because I was tired of paying for sync and wanted my notes in a format I actually own.

**Why I built this:**
- Obsidian is great, but it's closed source and sync costs $10/month
- Notion is powerful, but my data lives on their servers
- I wanted local-first, open source, and actually fast

**What makes Lokus different:**
- **Local-first**: Your notes are markdown files on YOUR device
- **Open source**: MIT licensed, fork it, read every line of code
- **Fast**: Built with Tauri/Rust, not Electron (50MB RAM vs 300MB+)
- **Feature-complete**: Wiki links, graph view, 18 task states, canvas, 40+ slash commands, 90+ template features

**What's coming:**
- P2P sync (in development) — your devices syncing directly, no cloud
- Plugin system with MCP integration for AI tools
- More customization options

I'd love to hear your feedback — what's working, what's not, what features you'd want to see.

If you have questions about the tech stack, architecture, or roadmap, ask away. I'm here all day.

## REDDIT r/selfhosted POST

**Title:** I built an open-source Obsidian alternative — local-first, no sync subscription

**Body:**

Hey r/selfhosted,

I've been working on Lokus, an open-source note-taking app, and wanted to share it with the community that would probably appreciate it most.

**What is it?**

A local-first note-taking app with wiki links, graph view, and a powerful template system. Think Obsidian but fully open source.

**Why I built it:**

I was frustrated that:
- Obsidian's sync costs $10/month
- Notion stores everything on their servers
- Most alternatives are either Electron-bloated or lack features

**Tech stack:**
- Tauri + Rust backend (not Electron)
- React + TipTap editor
- All notes are plain markdown files — no database, no SQLite

**Features:**
- Wiki links with fuzzy autocomplete
- Graph view for knowledge visualization
- 18 task states (todo, in-progress, urgent, delegated, etc.)
- Infinite canvas for visual thinking
- 40+ slash commands
- 90+ template features (variables, conditionals, date math)
- Full theming support

**What's coming:**
- P2P sync using Iroh (in development)
- Plugin system with MCP integration

**Self-hosting:**

Right now it's a desktop app (Mac/Windows/Linux) with local files. The P2P sync will let you sync between your own devices without any central server.

**Links:**
- Download: lokusmd.com
- GitHub: github.com/lokus-ai/lokus
- License: MIT

Would love feedback from this community. What features matter most to you for a self-hosted note solution?

## REDDIT r/ObsidianMD POST

**Title:** Made an open-source alternative (not meant to replace Obsidian, but for those who want FOSS)

**Body:**

Hey all,

Long-time Obsidian user here. I love Obsidian — it's genuinely great software. But I had a few itches:

1. It's closed source
2. Sync is $10/month (I know, I know, it's worth it for many)
3. I wanted to experiment with P2P sync

So I built Lokus as a side project. It's not meant to replace Obsidian — more of an alternative for the subset of users who prioritize open source.

**Similarities:**
- Local markdown files
- Wiki links with [[ syntax
- Graph view
- Daily notes + templates

**Differences:**
- Fully open source (MIT)
- Built with Tauri/Rust (smaller footprint than Electron)
- 18 task states instead of just checkboxes
- P2P sync in development (no subscription planned)

**What it doesn't have (yet):**
- Plugin ecosystem (planned)
- Mobile apps (future)
- Community themes (working on it)

I'm not here to bash Obsidian — it's a fantastic app and Sync is genuinely worth it for many. But if you've ever wanted a fully FOSS alternative, Lokus might scratch that itch.

GitHub: github.com/lokus-ai/lokus

Would love honest feedback from this community. What's missing that would make you consider switching (even partially)?

## LINKEDIN POST

**For professional network launch:**

I'm excited to share something I've been working on: Lokus, an open-source note-taking application.

The problem I was solving:
→ Note-taking apps either lock you into cloud ecosystems or charge monthly subscriptions for basic sync
→ Most "open source" alternatives are actually just source-available
→ Electron-based apps consume 300MB+ of RAM for a text editor

The solution:
→ Local-first architecture: your notes are markdown files on YOUR device
→ Fully open source (MIT license): fork it, audit it, contribute to it
→ Built with Tauri/Rust: ~50MB RAM, native performance

Key features:
• Wiki-style linking between notes
• Graph visualization of knowledge connections
• 18 task states for real workflow management
• Infinite canvas for visual thinking
• 40+ keyboard commands for power users

Currently available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

If you're interested in productivity tools, open source software, or just want to own your knowledge base, I'd love your feedback.

**First comment (post immediately after submission):**

I built Lokus because I wanted Obsidian's features without the closed-source aspect and sync subscription.

Tech stack: Tauri (Rust) + React + TipTap. Memory usage ~50MB vs 300MB+ for Electron apps.

Key features:
- Wiki links with autocomplete
- Graph view (D3 force simulation)
- 18 task states

- All notes are plain .md files

What it's missing:
- Mobile apps (planned)

The codebase is MIT licensed. PRs welcome.

Happy to answer questions about architecture decisions, trade-offs, or the roadmap.
