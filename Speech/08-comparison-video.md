## HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)
*[VISUAL: Three apps side by side]*

> "Obsidian, Notion, and Lokus. Three note-taking apps. Three different philosophies. Which one is right for you? Let's break it down."

---

## ROUND 1: WHERE YOUR DATA LIVES (0:15 - 1:00)
*[VISUAL: Split comparison]*

**NOTION:**
> "Notion stores everything in the cloud. Your notes, your databases, your entire second brain — it lives on their servers. Great for collaboration. Less great if you're privacy-conscious or if Notion has an outage."

**OBSIDIAN:**
> "Obsidian is local-first. Your notes are markdown files on your computer. But if you want to sync between devices, you either pay ten dollars a month for Obsidian Sync, or set up your own solution with iCloud or Syncthing."

**LOKUS:**
> "Lokus is also local-first. Plain markdown files. But it's working on peer-to-peer sync — your devices talking directly to each other, no cloud required. That's still in development, but it's the goal."

*[VISUAL: Winner badge]*

> "Winner for privacy: Obsidian and Lokus. Winner for collaboration: Notion."

---

## ROUND 2: OPEN SOURCE (1:00 - 1:35)
*[VISUAL: GitHub repos, license files]*

**NOTION:**
> "Notion is closed source. You can't see the code, can't audit it, can't contribute."

**OBSIDIAN:**
> "Obsidian is also closed source. Great software, but you're trusting the company."

**LOKUS:**
> "Lokus is fully open source. MIT license. Every line of code is on GitHub. Fork it, read it, contribute to it."

*[VISUAL: Winner badge]*

> "Winner: Lokus. And it's not close."

---

## ROUND 3: PERFORMANCE (1:35 - 2:10)
*[VISUAL: Memory usage graphs, app launch times]*

**NOTION:**
> "Notion runs in a browser or Electron. Expect three hundred megabytes of RAM or more. On slower machines, it can feel sluggish."

**OBSIDIAN:**
> "Obsidian is also Electron. Memory usage varies but typically sits around two hundred megabytes. Snappy for a note-taking app, but still Electron."

**LOKUS:**
> "Lokus is built with Tauri and Rust. Around fifty megabytes of RAM. Launches fast. Stays responsive. Native feel without native complexity."

*[VISUAL: Winner badge]*

> "Winner: Lokus for raw performance."

## ROUND 4: FEATURES (2:10 - 3:00)
*[VISUAL: Feature comparison table]*

> "Let's talk features."

**BASICS:**
> "All three do rich text editing, markdown support, and links between notes."

**WIKI LINKS:**
> "Obsidian and Lokus use double-bracket wiki links. Notion uses page links differently."

**GRAPH VIEW:**
> "Obsidian has the best graph view — lots of customization. Lokus has a solid graph view. Notion doesn't have one."

**TASKS:**
> "Notion has databases and kanban boards for task management. Obsidian has basic checkboxes plus plugins. Lokus has eighteen built-in task states — todo, in-progress, urgent, delegated, the works."

**CANVAS:**
> "Obsidian has Canvas. Lokus has Canvas. Notion has Notion so-so freeform pages."

**TEMPLATES:**
> "Notion has templates and databases. Obsidian has the Templater plugin. Lokus has ninety plus template features built in — variables, conditionals, date math."

*[VISUAL: It's close gesture]*

> "Features? It's close. Obsidian wins on plugin ecosystem. Notion wins on databases. Lokus wins on task states and built-in templates."

---

## ROUND 5: PRICING (3:00 - 3:30)
*[VISUAL: Pricing comparison]*

**NOTION:**
> "Free tier is solid. Plus is eight dollars per month. Add-ons for AI."

**OBSIDIAN:**
> "App is free. Sync is ten dollars a month. Publish is sixteen. Both add up if you want the full experience."

**LOKUS:**
> "Free. Forever. No paid tiers. No sync subscription. Open source."

*[VISUAL: Winner badge]*

> "Winner for value: Lokus. No contest."

---

## ROUND 6: MOBILE (3:30 - 3:50)
*[VISUAL: Phone screens]*

**NOTION:**
> "Notion has solid iOS and Android apps."

**OBSIDIAN:**
> "Obsidian has mobile apps too. Sync between desktop and mobile requires paid sync or third-party setup."

**LOKUS:**
> "Lokus is desktop only right now. Mac, Windows, Linux. Mobile is on the roadmap."

*[VISUAL: Winner badge]*

> "Winner for mobile: Notion and Obsidian. Lokus needs to catch up."

---

## FINAL VERDICT (3:50 - 4:30)
*[VISUAL: Summary cards]*

> "So which should you choose?"

**CHOOSE NOTION IF:**
> "You want collaboration, databases, and don't mind your data in the cloud."

**CHOOSE OBSIDIAN IF:**
> "You want a mature ecosystem with plugins, can afford sync, and don't need open source."

**CHOOSE LOKUS IF:**
> "You want true open source, maximum privacy, best performance, and you're okay without mobile for now."

*[VISUAL: Lokus highlight]*

> "For me personally? I built Lokus because I wanted ownership of my notes without a subscription. If that resonates with you, give it a try."

*[VISUAL: Download links, all three apps]*

> "Links to all three in the description. Try them all and pick what works for YOUR brain."

## END SCREEN (4:30 - 4:45)
