## HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)
*[VISUAL: Quick cuts of Obsidian pricing page, Notion loading spinner, cloud servers]*

**VOICEOVER:**

*[VISUAL: Show .md files in Finder/Explorer]*

> "No proprietary formats. No vendor lock-in. Just your notes, organized the way you want them."

## FEATURE 1: BEAUTIFUL EDITOR (0:45 - 1:15)

**VOICEOVER:**

*[VISUAL: Show code block with syntax highlighting]*

> "Code blocks with syntax highlighting. Math equations rendered beautifully with LaTeX."

*[VISUAL: Type $E = mc^2$ and show it render]*

## FEATURE 4: CANVAS (2:15 - 2:45)

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Sometimes you need to think visually. The canvas lets you arrange notes, draw diagrams, and connect ideas in two dimensions."

## FEATURE 5: TEMPLATES & SLASH COMMANDS (2:45 - 3:15)

- Match cuts to sentence endings

### AI Voice Settings
- Pace: Slightly faster than conversational (1.1x)
- Tone: Confident, knowledgeable
- Avoid: Overly enthusiastic "YouTuber" energy
- Model recommendation: ElevenLabs "Adam" or SPEECHMA "Matthew"
