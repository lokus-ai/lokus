## INTRO (0:00 - 0:20)
*[VISUAL: Casual setting, maybe desk setup or code on screen]*

> "I want to tell you why I spent months building a note-taking app when there are already hundreds of them."

*[VISUAL: Brief clips of Notion, Obsidian, Roam logos]*

> "And no, it's not because I thought I could do better. It's because I had a problem that none of them were solving."

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:20 - 1:00)
*[VISUAL: Pricing pages, cloud diagrams]*

> "I love Obsidian. I really do. It's powerful, it's fast, it uses local files. But two things bothered me."

> "First, it's closed source. I can't see the code. I can't fix bugs. I can't know exactly what it's doing with my data."

> "Second, sync costs ten dollars a month. For a lot of people, that's fine. But I'm a developer. I knew there had to be another way."

*[VISUAL: Notion loading, cloud servers]*

> "Notion? Great for teams. But my notes live on their servers. If Notion goes down, my second brain goes with it. And exporting? Good luck getting clean markdown out of there."

*[VISUAL: Frustrated expression or searching animation]*

> "I looked at Logseq, Anytype, Standard Notes. All good in different ways. But none of them were exactly what I wanted."

---

## THE DECISION (1:00 - 1:30)
*[VISUAL: Code editor, early commits]*

> "So I started building. At first it was just for me. A simple markdown editor that did wiki links. That's it."

> "But then I added a graph view. And tasks with multiple states. And a canvas. And templates. And before I knew it..."

*[VISUAL: Current Lokus interface]*

> "I had something real."

## THE PHILOSOPHY (1:30 - 2:10)
*[VISUAL: File system with .md files, open source badge]*

> "Here's what I believe: your notes are the most personal thing on your computer. More than photos, more than messages. They're literally your thoughts."

> "Those thoughts shouldn't be locked in a proprietary format. They shouldn't live on someone else's server. And you shouldn't have to pay rent to access them."

*[VISUAL: Markdown file in text editor]*

> "Lokus stores everything as plain markdown files. Open them in VS Code. Vim. Notepad. Whatever. They're yours forever."

*[VISUAL: GitHub repo]*

> "And the code is open source. MIT license. You can read every line. Fork it. Fix bugs. Add features. This is YOUR app."

---

## WHAT I'M PROUD OF (2:10 - 2:50)
*[VISUAL: Feature montage]*

> "Some things I'm genuinely proud of:"

> "The editor feels native. Not like a web app pretending to be a desktop app."

*[VISUAL: Wiki links + graph]*

> "Wiki links and graph view let you connect ideas the way your brain actually works."

*[VISUAL: Task states]*

> "Eighteen task states because life is more complicated than 'done or not done.'"

*[VISUAL: Canvas]*

> "An infinite canvas for when you need to think spatially."

*[VISUAL: Templates in action]*

> "And a template system that might be overkill, but it makes daily notes and project planning actually work."

---

## WHAT'S NEXT (2:50 - 3:20)
*[VISUAL: Roadmap or abstract network]*

> "What I'm most excited about is peer-to-peer sync. Your devices talking directly to each other. No cloud. No subscription. No middleman."

> "It's still in development, but that's the vision. Your notes, syncing for free, forever."

*[VISUAL: Plugin/AI logos]*

> "After that, plugins and AI integration. I want Lokus to be a platform, not just an app."

---

## CLOSING (3:20 - 3:45)
*[VISUAL: Download page, GitHub stars]*

> "Lokus is free. Download it, try it, tell me what you think."

> "And if you believe that note-taking should be open source, star the repo on GitHub. It helps more than you'd think."

*[VISUAL: Personal sign-off]*

> "Thanks for listening to my story. I hope Lokus helps you think better."

*[VISUAL: Logo + links]*
